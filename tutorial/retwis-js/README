Description:

    Redis tutorial program impelmented by node.js. 
    This program is originated from retwis-py.

Dependencies:

    node.js (0.3.0) with following npm modules:
    
       - express@1.0.0rc4
       - redis@0.3.7

Usage:

    node redis.js

Limitations:

   - need more strict error handling.
   - We use only one client to connect redis. It works well under multi request environment,
     but we do not confirm it is efficient or not.
